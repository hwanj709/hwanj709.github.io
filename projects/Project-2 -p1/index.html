            Going with the Flow - Eleanor Morgan

              <li><strong>Skim and choose a text from this list. Once you’ve chosen one, 
                read the text multiple times, interpret it from all angles. 
                What is the subject matter in your own words? Consider the tone, 
                syntax, word choices, sentence and paragraph length, rhythm...What 
                images or associations does it bring up? Is it visual, metaphoric, 
                descriptive, are there a lot of nouns or adjectives? Is it sparse, 
                dense or in between? </strong>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>The author talks about women's menstruation and the PMS, mainly focusing
                  on mood changes and feeling "horomonal". Eleanor Morgan seemed like telling 
                  us that there is no need to be scared of or anxious of the change that our 
                  body goes through, it is just a natural state and through horomonal prescriptions
                  that pain and fluctuating mood could also be managed.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li><strong>Of all your findings, what do you want to point out to the reader 
                about this text in your designed interpretation? How might you do it? </strong>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs, someone always knows better.
                </li>
                <li>Given what I now know about the imprecision of the science of how our hormones can affect our 
                  mood,I try to see my distress as part of a mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, 
                  asking myself: what else is going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I right now? What helps?
                </li>
                <li>Perhaps, then, a more realistic phrase than, “It’s just my hormones,” would be, “My hormones might 
                  predispose me to feeling terrible sometimes.”
                </li>
                <li>But what is “myself” if not a sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always changing and 
                  responding to the world it inhabits and the people around it? From what fixed, ideal state do 
                  I feel I am slipping when I am more emotional for the second half of the month?
                </li>
                <li>Menstruation is another rhythm unique to women.
                </li>
