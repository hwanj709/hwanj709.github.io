            In the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I looked around at all
            the women in the carriage. Middle-aged women hurtling towards the suburbs.
            Pregnant women holding their lower backs. Teenage girls slick with sebum. 
            Elderly women standing stoically by the doors. I realised every one of them 
            will have some story about how their reproductive systems have affected their 
            lives. And I thought: how much have you kept secret?<br>

            Because one day in our early lives as women, everything changes. We start 
            <select name="keyword" id="keyword">
                <option value="bleeding">BLEEDING</option>
                <option value="once">once</option>
                <option value="every">every</option>
                <option value="month">month</option>
            </select>. And in an instant we’re no longer a child. I was on a crazy golf 
            course overlooking Cromer pier when I experienced period pain for the first 
            time. My lower body rippled with a new sensation. It was a pain that didn’t 
            fit inside my body, burning through my thighs. I explained to Dad that I didn’t 
            feel well. I was aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a way that I 
            absolutely did not have the language for. That British coastal perfume, thick 
            with sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea that came with 
            these sharp churns to another level. I had to sit down on the grass. The pain 
            spoke to me. It told me my human fabric had changed. As evidence of the encoding 
            that happened, now when I hear seagulls, I still have flash visions of lying down 
            holding my belly.<br>

            I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a physical and mental slog. 
            It is thought that 90% of women experience some premenstrual changes, even if mildly. 
            There are more than 150 clinically identified symptoms of PMS, including irritability, 
            anxiety, depression and headaches. A laugh riot, in other words.<br>
