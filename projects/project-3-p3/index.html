                <li><strong>What is the context / story?</strong>
                    <br>Inspired from @jamesandkarla, the collector's original concept was to create an archive investigating vintage typography from our daily life surroundings. </li>
                <li><strong>What is the content?</strong>
                    <br>The backgorunds of the photos are mostly buildings or shops since they are taken from the streets.</li>
                <li><strong>What is the quality of image?</strong>
                    <br>The images aren't professional quality since they are freely taken around the city.</li>
                <li><strong>Where do they come from?</strong>
                    <br>The photos are taken originally by the collector from the streets of New York, assuming from the light source, most of the photos are taken during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Do they have a material quality?</strong><br>Images are photographed, photographed objects are physical signs.</li>
